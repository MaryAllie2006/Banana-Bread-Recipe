 Preparing:
 Set oven to 350â„‰ 
 Grab a bowl, crack the two eggs into it, whip eggs, and set bowl aside.
 In another bowl mash two overripe bananas, you can choose to leave lumps or not. 
 Leaving lumps just means you will have clumps of banana in your bread which still tastes good.
 (Tip: The riper the banana the sweeter it tastes.)
 Grab a stick of butter and rub the inside of the bread pan or spray non-stick oil spray inside of the bread pan. 
 
 Making batter:

 Sift two cups of all purpose flour into a large bowl. 
 Add in all dry ingrediants (flour,baking soda, salt, and brown sugar) to the bowl with the sifted flour. 
 Gently stir all the dry ingrediants together. 
 Grab the bowls with whipped eggs and mashed bananas and add into the bowl with the dry ingrediants, do not mix. 
 
 In a small cooking pan melt a 1/2 cup of butter. It is important to NOT put any less or your batter will be sticky.
 (Tip: for the butter to melt faster, cut butter into smaller portions)
 Once the butter is melted IMMEDIATELY pour and mix into the bowl with the other ingrediants. 
 Keep stirring for two minutes or until the batter is completely mixed with no lumps(unless you left some from the mashed bananas). Make sure the batter is neither too runny or sticky, the bread will still taste good but won't rise as its supposed to. 
 Once you have mixed the batter, pour it into the bread pan and sprinkle the crushed walnuts on top of the bread batter if desired.
 Then place the bread pan with the batter into the oven for 1 hour and 10 minutes. 
 (Tip: do not open the oven when baking or the heat will escape, taking the bread longer to bake.) 
 Once you take our the bread from the oven let it cool down for 10 minutes. 
 Then take it out of the pan and enjoy.
